# Programs that are in this folder

`H_bridge_variable_frequency`: generate a square waveform with variable frequency in through the H-bridge. The frequency varies from 10kHz to 100kHz with a step of 1Khz.

`HybridControl_phi_2022`: old control that replicate an amplitude modulation behavior. The core of the controller is indeed in the 'blocks' folder.

`LLC_hybrid_2023_july`: hopefully, wanna be the control that will be implement  frequency+amplitude modulation with the close loop on the output current.

`SensingTest_ADC`: programs that generate a square waveform in the H-bridge, which is then used to test the ADC measurements on the daughter board by replicating the signal in the DAC.
