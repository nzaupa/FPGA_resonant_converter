This folder contains the `*.sof` files that can be directly uploaded to the FPGA

 - `TOP_HybridControl_theta_phi_OL-20240510-working.sof`: this files contains all the things to test the control laws in open-loop.
   - $\theta$-control is implemented as the day 0
   - $\varphi$-control is implemented in the $z$-plane
   - $(\varphi,\delta)$-control is implemented in the $x$-plane
   - There is the possibility to change with external buttons
     - $\varphi$ button
     - $\delta$ button
     - dead-time with dip-switch
     - show ADC values on 7-segment display

 - `TOP_HybridControl_theta_phi_OL-20240510-working_x.sof`: this files contains an updated version of the one before. The control law with PHI has been implemented in the $x$-plane. This improved the range in which the control law is able to work. Essentially, now it can go full range with the angle.

     - show ADC values on 7-segment display
 - `TOP_HybridControl_theta_phi_CL-20240514-working.sof`: this has a version of the closed loop working. The gains haven't been tuned and it is without anti-windup.
   - $\varphi$ is modified by the PI module. It is limited by the saturation but the 32bit value had to been reduced before.
   - sw[0] is the ENABLE
   - sw[1] is used to choose the debug digital signal
   - sw[2] there is the possibility to pass to open-loop with $\varphi$ on button[1]
   - sw[3] show either PHI or what is on the dip-switch in the 7-seg display.
   - In closed loop there is the possibility to change:
     - $I_{ref}$ at step of 0.5A with button[1] to increase and button[3] to decrease; reset with CPU_RESET (button[4]).
     - $\delta$ with button[3] and reset with button[0].
   - dip-switch
     - [0] $I_{ref}$
     - [1] $\delta$
     - [2-3] dead time selection 
     - [4] $V_{bat}$ in HEX
     - [5] $I_{bat}$ in HEX
     - [6] $V_{bat}$ in DEC
     - [7] $I_{bat}$ in DEC
 - `TOP_HybridControl_theta_phi_CL-20240524-working.sof`: this has the closed-loop working with some features improved. Namely, it can work down to small amplitudes (phi up to 70/75)
   - there is still the possibility to go in open-loop mode with sw[2] and change phi with: button[1] (++), button[2] (--), and button[0] (reset).
   - sw[0] is the ENABLE
   - sw[1] is used to choose the debug digital signal: 0 is PHI, 1 is the 1st 8bit of dead-zone.
   - sw[2] there is the possibility to pass to open-loop with $\varphi$ on button[1]
   - sw[3] show either PHI or what is on the dip-switch in the 7-seg display.
   - In closed-loop the gain are: Kp=3, shift_Kp=13, TsKi=1, shift_Ki=12, Kaw=0, shift_Kaw=0.
     - $I_{ref}$ at step of 0.5A with button[1] to increase and button[3] to decrease; reset with button[0].
     - $\delta$ with button[3] and reset with `CPU_RESET` (button[4]).
   - dip-switch
     - [0] $I_{ref}$
     - [1] $\delta$
     - [2-3] dead time selection 
     - [4] $V_{bat}$ in HEX
     - [5] $I_{bat}$ in HEX
     - [6] $V_{bat}$ in DEC
     - [7] $I_{bat}$ in DEC
   - Improvements:
     - regularization is improved;
     - there is a 4 sample filter on Ibat, sampled at 100kHz;
     - state machine is always passing through 0 even with phi=0;
     - saturation at 0 is hardcoded;
     - change in CLK for state-machine, now it is looking two time step back for the reset.
