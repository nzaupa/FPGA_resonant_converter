Went back to work on it after a long period dedicated to the lecture at UPS.

1st week of January - Found a (the) problem in the state machine. Regularization cannot be applied to jumpsets signals since two out of four are only an impulse, therefore it cannot be regularized. We might think to different variable that could be controlled/regularized. To discover this I simulated the controller with ModelSim feeding waveform from a PSIM simulation (directly vC and iC of the ADC).

2nd week of January - Try to set up a simulator for the dynamics of the converter. So far it seems good, I discovered of the priority of arithmetic vs logic operations. This took me several hours of trial and error among ModelSim, PSIM and MATLAB.

9 January - Simulation module for LLC is working, a module to transform the output to an ADC like is missing. -->
