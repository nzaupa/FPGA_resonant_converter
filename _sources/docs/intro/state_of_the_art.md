## Why our method is worth a paper

Here I try to collect a not-complete list of reasons why our
contribution is meaningful.

-   ensure soft-switching, ZVS (we should look also at ZCS for the
    rectifier);

-   self-sustained oscillations;

-   no time (angle) dependency in the control law thanks to the phase
    plane approach;

-   wide range of conversion ratios with a narrow range of operating
    frequencies - optimal magnetics;

-   ...

Some open question:

1.  How much is it important a bidirectional converter for OBC?

2.  how feasible is this control approach with low-cost electronics?

3.  ...
